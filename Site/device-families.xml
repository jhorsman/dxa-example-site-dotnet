        <!-- Provide a list of AND conditions that check values of context-claims against values specified here.
           
             Possible values for condition checks are:
                true, false (i.e. boolean values such as device.mobile)
                <,> (i.e. <= or >= numeric checks such as device.displayWidth)
                string values comparison (i.e. device.vendor)
      
        An example list of conditions to select the featurephone view would be:
        check device.mobile is true AND device.tablet is false AND device.displayWidth <= 320
